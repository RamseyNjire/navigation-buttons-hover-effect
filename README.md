# Project Name

> This project is a code-along of Dark Code's [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmFiEW_O8L8&list=PL_t969ALyXznbLyI7LDN7WHmZxAf3nILA).

I loved the original tutorial, and definitely learned a lot from it. I made a few changes as a matter of preference. The navbar was a ul, rather than a div, while the background color and the shapes of the links are different. Other than that, it's largely inspired by Dark Code's tutorial. I loved working on it a lot and I hope anyone who checks it out will too!
